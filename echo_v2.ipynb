Specifically, we should ask questions to understand:\\n* What are the buyer's objections to adopting a digital adoption platform?\\n* What are the key timelines for implementing a solution?\\n* What are the success indicators for a digital adoption platform?\\n* What are the budget constraints for this project?\\n* Who are the competitors, and how does the buyer perceive them?\\n\\nBy uncovering this information, we can better understand the buyer's needs and tailor our solution to address their challenges, increasing the chances of a successful deal.\",\n",

They are struggling to balance oil demand with climate goals and their users are not adopting new tools quickly enough, impacting productivity and efficiency. Shell is concerned about integration with existing systems, needs a high degree of customization to meet their unique requirements, and is also concerned about the cost and implementation timeline of a digital adoption platform. The decision committee involved in the call includes IT, operations, business leaders, the CEO Wael Sawan, Mark (Shell icon), and shareholders.'}]}"
